## What It Does
This is a helper tool for listing items in the marketplace trade chat in Dark and Darker.

Click the 'Set' button to create draggable circles, which you can place ontop of the items you wish to list in your inventory/stash. Right click the 'Set' button to delete the circle that was last created.

Enter the text you want to send with your listing.

Once your circles have been set, click the 'Start' button to begin listing! The tool will shift+click the items where your circles are located, and send the listing with your text to chat. This will perform the function roughly every 10 seconds, which is the time limit in the trade chat.

Click the 'Stop' button to end the listing function, and click the 'Reset' button to reset all circles and text.

This tool includes a check that will only function if you have Dark and Darker running.
